# PRODIGY_DS_03
OVERVIEW:
This project utilizes the Bank Marketing dataset to build a decision tree classifier. The classifier predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains features such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing campaign outcomes.

PROJECT GOALS:

Build a decision tree classifier to predict customer subscriptions to term deposits.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Evaluate the performance of the classifier using relevant metrics.
Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
DATASET:

The dataset used in this project is bank-additional-full.csv, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following features:

Demographic data (age, job, marital status, education)
Behavioral data (past marketing campaign outcomes, contact methods)
Target variable: Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)

TOOLS USED:
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics
GOOGLE COLLAB: Interactive data exploration and model building
Contents
Notebooks: GOOGLE COLLAB containing Python code for data cleaning, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Data: Contains the bank-additional-full.csv dataset file.
Documentation: Project reports, findings, conclusions, and any additional documentation related to the analysis.

Future Enhancements
Implement other machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) for comparison.
Fine-tune model hyperparameters for improved performance.
Explore feature engineering techniques to enhance model predictive power.
